## DAT250: Programming Assignment 1

### High-level Design of an Auction Enterprise Application

In this assignment you will design the Java EE enterprise application that you will then implement in the subsequent programming assignment. The design and implementation of the Java EE application is to be undertaken in groups of 2-4 students.

The main requirements for the application is provided below. In addition, you will find an example design document for a phone book application.  Use this design document as a template for your own design document.

Each group is required to give a short presentation of their design document (see the course canvas for details), and also submit their design document in PDF format via canvas. It is recommended to structure the design document so that it can be used directly for the presentation.

For creating the design diagrams (use cases, domain model, and application flow) you may use tools such as

* Cacoo - https://cacoo.com/
* Umbrello UML Modeller - http://uml.sourceforge.net
* Draw IO - http://draw.io

or some other suitable tool you may know from earlier.

#### The OpenPhoneBook example

The OpenPhoneBook example application should help you to create a proper design document. Use it as template for the application that you are going to develop.

OpenPhoneBook is an application for sharing phone numbers between registered users. Membership is free. Everyone can join the community by registering via a web form. Each logged-in user can search by last name as well as city for phone numbers of other registered users. Furthermore, each user can update his or her own information. Several addresses can be registered by each user and several phone numbers can be associated with an address. To keep it simple, mobile phone numbers are not handled in a special way.

##### Use Cases

The use cases give an overview of the basic functionality to be provided by the application. Usually each use case is subsequently redefined in a set of more precise diagrams. However, in this application this is not necessary since the use cases are relatively simple. Therefore only a single use case diagram (see figure below) is created. This should be sufficient also in the case of your application.

* **Register in OpenPhoneBook:** Everyone can register his addresses and phone numbers via a web form.
* **Update own data:** Users of the OpenPhoneBook can change the data via another web form, e.g., if they have moved and got a new phone number.
* **Search phone number:** Each user can search for phone numbers of other users via their last name and/or city.

##### Domain Model

The domain model shows the required concepts of the application and their relations. These are in this case *Users*, *Addresses* and *Phone Numbers*. These objects are stored in the database. Classes that encode application logic and helper classes are not part of the domain model.

The OpenPhoneBook application requires the concepts shown in the figure below. User names (uname) should be unique and passwords should be mandatory.

##### Application Flow Diagram

Screen transitions (in the web tier) should be modelled using a basic state machine. Each screen should be modelled as state. Each action (button/link which can be pressed) should be modelled as transition (arrow). A condition (guard) for a transition is written in brackets `[guard]`.

Furthermore, transitions which result from possible errors should be coloured red. If there is a red transition, then there should be also a green one covering the case when an error did not occur. Uncoloured transitions can be merged if it makes sense (see: `Add address`, `Add phone number`, `Remove (address)` and `Remove (phone number)` have been merged to a single transition.

The application consists of three screens. Only logged-in users can search for phone numbers of other users. The `User Data Screen` has multiple uses. It is used for registering as a new user and also for updating user data. Button  `Cancel membership` deletes the user from the phone book. If the button is pressed by an unregistered user, the user is also sent to the `Login Screen` (nothing has to be deleted).

##### User Screens

The user screen mock-ups is intended to prototype the application and give a better feeling how the application will work. The user screens are created in HTML. At the design stage you may use any graphic program to create and sketch the mock-up screens.

In `Login Screen` (see figure below) you can enter the application or be forwarded to a page were you can register as new user.

In `Search Phone Number Screen` (see figure below) each user can search by `Last name` and/or `City` for other users. Phone numbers found will appear in a table. If there is no result, a message `no matches` is shown instead of the table.

In `User Data Screen` (see figure below) a user can register as a new member, change his data or cancel his membership. Addresses are shown in a list. Each *Address* have a sublist containing all the phone numbers for the address. The data is validated when pressing the save button. It is checked that each set of data is complete. In addition, it is validated that the phone number is numerical. Furthermore, it is checked that the user adds add least one address and one phone number. Error messages shown are

* User data is not complete.
* Address <1> is not complete.
* Phone number <1> of Address <1> is not complete.
* Phone number <1> of Address <1> is not numeric.

#### The Auction Application

This is the application that you are required to design and implement.

The requirements below may be incomplete and it is your task to design a useful application so try to find a proper balance in terms of the features that you want to support. The application should not be too complex and not too simple either.

Keep in mind that you have to implement the application in the three subsequent programming assignments.

You are given the following requirements and assumptions concerning the application

1. Design an auction place where sellers can display product catalogs and where customers (i.e., bidders) can search for products.
2. A product description should contain the following information:
    * Product name, picture, features and product rating
    * Customers feedback
    * Current bid
    * Time remaining to close the bidding
    * Contact information of sellers (e.g. name, phone and email)   
    * Sellers ratings
3. Product must be in published status before they are visible by the customers.
4. Products that are in published status are listed in the auction place starting with the oldest entries on top.
5. Customers can filter products by category and free text search.
6. Customers must login before they can place a bid.
7. Customers can bid for a product by placing a bid higher than the current bid.
8. Once sold to a customer, the customer can provide feedback for the product.

Note that you are not required to process payment gateways to complete the purchase.

An optional requirement, if you like to enhance the application, is that a bidder can create an event for automatic bidding: a bidder might configure an event such as: *Keep bidding for a product until it reaches 6500 NOK*.
